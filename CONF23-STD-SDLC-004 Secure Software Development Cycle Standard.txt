- **LLM**: OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 (LLM01-LLM10).
    - *Priority*: Mitigation of Prompt Injection (LLM01), Excessive Agency (LLM06), and Vector Weaknesses (LLM08).
- **ENTERPRISE**: **ISO 27001** (Annex A Technical Controls).
- **INDUSTRIAL**: **ISA/IEC 62443-4-2** (Technical Security Requirements for IACS).

## 4. EXECUTION WORKFLOW
1. **ANTIGRAVITY OPTIMIZATION**: Prompts optimized for Gemini Flash Pro 3.1; structured for iterative side-by-side editing.
2. **SOLID ARCHITECTURE**: Strict adherence to DRY and SOLID principles.
3. **SECURITY BY DESIGN**: Early mitigation of Top 10 risks.
4. **AUTOMATED BUILD**: Mandatory `build.cmd` for zero-touch install, config, and deployment.

## 5. DOCUMENTATION & AGILITY
### 5.1. Engineering Deliverables (ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 standard)
	Automatic generation and update of the following markdown files:
5.1.1. "DOC01_CONOS_Concept_of_Operations.md" Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
- Purpose: This is an organization-level document that describes the leadership's intent and assumptions regarding how the business will operate.
- Role: It serves as the foundation for eliciting requirements and understanding the project's background.
5.1.2. "DOC02_BRS_Business_Requirements_Specification.md" Business Requirements Specification (BRS)
- Purpose: Describes the organization's motivation for developing the system and defines the high-level processes and policies it must follow.
- Role: It represents requirements at the business management level.
5.1.3. "DOC03_StRS_Stakeholder_Requirements_Specification.md" Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS)
- Purpose: Formally documents the needs of users, operators, and other stakeholders.
- Role: It bridges the gap between the BRS and the technical system requirements, often incorporating a System Operational Concept (OpsCon) to describe the system from the user's viewpoint.
5.1.4. "DOC04_SyRS_System_Requirements_Specification.md" System Requirements Specification (SyRS)
- Purpose: Specifies the technical requirements for the system as a whole, including its interactions with the environment, performance parameters, and constraints.
- Role: Acts as the definitive technical "bridge" between the acquirer’s needs and the builders' technical tasks.
5.1.5. "DOC05_SRS_Software_Requirements_Specification.md" Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Purpose: If the system includes software elements, the SRS defines the specific functions, interfaces, and quality attributes (like security and portability) for those software components.
- Role: Represents the lowest level of requirements engineering before design and implementation.

### 5.2. Scrum Artifacts
The following artifacts must be maintained and delivered:
- **Core**: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment (Source Code).
- **Files**: `[Project]_ProductBacklog.md`, `[Project]_DefinitionOfDone.md`, and a collection of category-specific **ADRs**.
