# DOC02 - Business Requirements Specification (BRS)

## 1. Motivation
Organizations and supply chains operating in European soil require accurate, timely, and actionable intelligence. Current solutions are fragmented. Nuño Europolitics centralizes this intelligence cycle into one coherent, scalable solution.

## 2. High-Level Processes
- **Data Ingestion**: Manual insertion of validated intelligence reports by verified analysts.
- **Risk Assessment**: Presentation of macro-level geopolitical data in interactive datagrids.
- **Learning & Dissemination**: A module strictly dedicated to training users in intelligence techniques.

## 3. Business Policies & Constraints
- The platform MUST be lightweight and fully operational on a single machine or air-gapped environment if required.
- The use of third-party external DB providers is strictly forbidden in this phase.
- All code must comply with the CONF23-STD-SDLC-004 Standard.

## 4. Future Roadmap Integration
The solution serves as the foundation (MVP) before eventually shifting towards advanced LLM integration and SAAS distribution models once business validation is reached.
