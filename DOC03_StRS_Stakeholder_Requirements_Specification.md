# DOC03 - Stakeholder Requirements Specification (StRS)

## 1. User Profiles
- **Intelligence Analyst**: Needs to quickly input raw intelligence and classify it based on source validity.
- **Strategy Manager**: Needs zero-friction dashboards to rapidly ascertain supply chain risks in Europe and bordering areas.
- **Training Lead**: Needs a dedicated hub to deploy training material on structured analytical techniques.

## 2. System Operational Concept (OpsCon)
The stakeholders will access a local web interface natively served by Streamlit. The application loads instantly upon launching the `build.cmd` script. They will interact primarily through graphical tabs corresponding to the 5 core functionalities. 

At any moment, analysts can switch between the Risk Dashboard and the Intelligence Input Form to ensure their findings are structurally logged.

## 3. Reporting Needs
Management needs the system to summarize existing intelligence reports in a unified table, easily exportable or viewable in a tabular format natively in Streamlit.
